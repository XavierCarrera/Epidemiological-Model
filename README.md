<h2>About this project:</h2>

This Numeric Model is my project for the [Applied Mathematical Models Workshop at Platzi](https://platzi.com/clases/modelos-numericos-2020/)

As well, this is one of the challenges for Platzi Master -- an education acceleration program to form the future tech leaders in LATAM.

<h2>Brief description: </h2>

The objective of this course was to use the concepts of Dynamic and Chaotic Systems in order to compare exact solutions vs numeric solutions. For this purpose, I used real data from the COVID19 pandemic to apply a SIRD Model (susceptible, infected, recovered, dead). The final outcome is the analysis of four behavoirs, in which we apply differential equations to find tendencies on the growth of infected, recovered and dead individuals.
